# ✅ CORS Issue Fixed - Quick Summary

## What Was the Problem?
You were getting:
```
CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header
```

**Root cause:** Trying to call Resend API directly from browser (not allowed for security)

---

## What Was Done?

### 1. Created Netlify Function ✨
**File:** `netlify/functions/send-invitation-email.ts`
- Handles email sending server-side
- No CORS issues
- API key stays secret

### 2. Updated Email Service 🔧
**File:** `src/services/EmailNotificationService.ts`
- Now calls Netlify Function instead of Resend directly
- `sendOrganizationInvitationEmail()` updated

### 3. Configuration Changes ⚙️
- Netlify configuration - Added functions config
- `package.json` - Added `@netlify/functions` dependency

### 4. Fixed Email Logging 🐛
- Made logging optional (won't error if table missing)

---

## 🚀 Next Steps (Do This Now!)

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Set Environment Variables in Netlify

Go to: **Netlify Dashboard → Site Settings → Environment Variables**

Add these **server-side** variables:
```
RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_resend_api_key
FROM_EMAIL=noreply@yourdomain.com
```

**Important:** 
- ❌ Don't use `VITE_RESEND_API_KEY` (that's client-side, insecure)
- ✅ Use `RESEND_API_KEY` (server-side, secure)

### 3. Deploy
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix CORS: Add Netlify Function for emails"
git push
```

### 4. Test
- Go to Organization Settings
- Try sending an invitation
- Should work! ✅

## 🧪 Testing Locally (Optional)

```bash
# Install Netlify CLI
npm install -g netlify-cli

# Create .env for local testing
echo "RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_key" > .env
echo "FROM_EMAIL=your@email.com" >> .env

# Run with Netlify Functions
netlify dev
```

Open: `http://localhost:8888` (not 5173)
