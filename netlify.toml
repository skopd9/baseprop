  # Exclude documentation files from secret scanning (they contain example placeholders)
  SECRETS_SCAN_OMIT_PATHS = "*.md,*.MD"
  # Note: VITE_* environment variables are embedded in the client bundle by design.
  # If these are marked as "secrets" in Netlify UI but are meant to be public
  # (like Supabase anon key or OAuth client IDs), you should either:
  # 1. Remove them from Netlify's "Secrets" and add as regular environment variables, OR
  # 2. Add them to SECRETS_SCAN_SMART_DETECTION_OMIT_VALUES in Netlify UI
