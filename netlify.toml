  # Exclude documentation and build output from secret scanning
  # Build output (dist/) contains client-side API keys that are meant to be public
  SECRETS_SCAN_OMIT_PATHS = "*.md,*.MD,dist/**"
  # Note: VITE_* environment variables are embedded in the client bundle by design.
  # Client-side keys like Google Maps API keys (AIza*) and Supabase anon keys are safe
  # to expose because they're protected by domain restrictions, not secrecy.
