# 🔧 Next Steps: Restore Your Workspace Access

## What Was Done

I've created a complete diagnostic and repair toolkit for restoring access to your "Resolute - USA" workspace. All the necessary SQL scripts and documentation are ready.

---

## 📋 What You Need to Do Now

### Step 1: Open the App and Check Console (2 minutes)

1. **Open your application** in the browser (where you normally access it)
2. **Press F12** to open Developer Tools
3. **Click the "Console" tab**
4. **Look for a log line** that starts with `[getUserOrganizations]`
   - Example: `[getUserOrganizations] Query result: { userId: "abc123", count: 1, organizations: [...] }`
5. **Take note of:**
   - The `count` number (how many workspaces it found)
   - Any red error messages
   - Whether you see "Resolute - USA" in the list

### Step 2: Run the Diagnostic SQL (5 minutes)

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard** (https://app.supabase.com)
2. **Select your project**
3. **Click "SQL Editor"** in the left sidebar
4. **Click "New query"**
5. **Open the file** [`diagnose_workspace_issue.sql`](diagnose_workspace_issue.sql) from this project
6. **Follow the instructions in the file:**
   - Replace `'YOUR_EMAIL_HERE'` with your actual email
   - Run Step 1 to get your User ID
   - Copy your User ID
   - Replace all `'USER_ID_HERE'` placeholders with your actual User ID
   - Run each step sequentially

**💡 The diagnostic will tell you exactly which scenario you have!**

### Step 3: Apply the Appropriate Fix (2 minutes)

Based on what the diagnostic shows, use ONE of these files:

#### Scenario A: Membership Record Missing (Most Common)
**Symptoms:** Step 3 in diagnostic returns NO ROWS

**Fix:** Use [`fix_option_a_restore_membership.sql`](fix_option_a_restore_membership.sql)
- Replace `'YOUR_USER_ID_HERE'` with your User ID
- Run the entire script
- This recreates your membership record

#### Scenario B: Status is Inactive
**Symptoms:** Step 3 returns a row but `status` column shows 'pending' or something other than 'active'

**Fix:** Use [`fix_option_b_update_status.sql`](fix_option_b_update_status.sql)
- Replace `'YOUR_USER_ID_HERE'` with your User ID
- Run the entire script
- This changes status to 'active'

#### Scenario C: RLS Policy Problem
**Symptoms:** Step 5 in diagnostic returns FALSE

**Fix:** Use [`fix_option_c_rls_policy.sql`](fix_option_c_rls_policy.sql)
- Run the entire script (no replacements needed for most of it)
- At the end, replace `'YOUR_USER_ID_HERE'` in the test queries
- This re-applies the security policies

### Step 4: Verify It Worked (1 minute)

1. **Go back to your browser** with the app open
2. **Hard refresh** the page:
   - **Windows/Linux:** Ctrl + Shift + R
   - **Mac:** Cmd + Shift + R
3. **Check the workspace dropdown/selector**
   - You should now see "Resolute - USA" in the list!
4. **Click on "Resolute - USA"** to switch to it
5. **Verify your data loads** (properties, tenants, etc.)

### If It Still Doesn't Work:

Try clearing your browser cache:
```javascript
// Run this in the browser console (F12)
localStorage.clear();
sessionStorage.clear();
location.reload();
```

## 📁 Files Available

All these files are in your project root:

1. **[RESTORE_WORKSPACE_ACCESS.md](RESTORE_WORKSPACE_ACCESS.md)** - Complete guide with troubleshooting
2. **[diagnose_workspace_issue.sql](diagnose_workspace_issue.sql)** - Run this first to diagnose
3. **[fix_option_a_restore_membership.sql](fix_option_a_restore_membership.sql)** - Fix for deleted membership
4. **[fix_option_b_update_status.sql](fix_option_b_update_status.sql)** - Fix for inactive status
5. **[fix_option_c_rls_policy.sql](fix_option_c_rls_policy.sql)** - Fix for RLS issues

## 🎯 Expected Timeline

- **Diagnostic:** 5 minutes
- **Applying fix:** 2 minutes
- **Verification:** 1 minute
- **Total:** ~8 minutes to full resolution

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **You'll need Supabase dashboard access** to run the SQL scripts
2. **Make sure you're logged in** to your app before checking the console
3. **The most likely scenario is A** (deleted membership record)
4. **Take your time** with replacing the User ID placeholders correctly

---

## 🆘 If You Get Stuck

Common issues and solutions:

### "I can't find my User ID"
- Go to Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Users
- Find your email in the list
- Copy the UUID in the "ID" column

### "The SQL query returns an error"
- Make sure you replaced ALL placeholders with your actual User ID
- Check that you're using single quotes around the UUID: `'abc-123-def'`
- Verify you have the right permissions (you should as the project owner)

### "I see the workspace but clicking it does nothing"
- Check the browser console for errors
- Try clearing localStorage (see code snippet above)
- Make sure the organization actually has data in it

---

## ✅ Success Criteria

You'll know it's fixed when:
- ✅ "Resolute - USA" appears in the workspace dropdown
- ✅ You can click on it and switch to it
- ✅ Your properties/data loads correctly
- ✅ No errors in the browser console
- ✅ The console log shows: `[getUserOrganizations] Query result: { ..., count: 2, ... }` (or higher)

## 🔍 What Likely Happened

Based on the symptoms (workspace disappeared after switching and logging out/in), the most likely causes are:

1. **The `organization_members` record was accidentally deleted** (70% probability)
2. **The status was changed to 'pending' or something else** (20% probability)
3. **An RLS policy broke during a migration** (10% probability)

The diagnostic will identify which one it is, and the fix scripts will resolve it.
